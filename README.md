## IMPORTANT NOTE
Quark has failed to match LINQ performance consistently, let alone exceed it (surprising considering enumerable overhead).

I will be dropping the project for now, and releasing this code to the Public Domain (BSD-3 => Unlicense).

# Quark

Quark is a high performance drop-in replacement for the .NET LINQ library.

Click [here](https://yellowsink.github.io/quark) to see docs, articles, benchmarks, etc.

Quark does make a few **small** changes for performance, but its still worth it to go over our
[changes page](https://yellowsink.github.io/quark/articles/changes).
